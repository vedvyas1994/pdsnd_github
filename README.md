# Explore US Bikeshare Data
#### by Vedavyas Kamath <br><br>


## Description
Used Python to explore data related to bike share systems for three major cities in the United States, Chicago, New York City, and Washington. In this project, first I have imported the data based on city name provided by user and then answered interesting questions about it by computing descriptive statistics.

## Files used
chicago.csv, washington.csv, new_york_city.csv <br>
The files are large in size because of which I have not uploaded in the repository. Please find the files available for download
